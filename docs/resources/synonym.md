# typesense_synonym (Resource)

Manages a Typesense synonym configuration for a collection. Synonyms help improve search relevance by expanding queries to include related terms.

Typesense supports two types of synonyms:

- **Multi-way synonyms**: All terms are treated as equivalent (e.g., "sneaker" = "shoe" = "trainer")
- **One-way synonyms**: Terms map to a root word (e.g., "blazer", "coat" → "jacket")

## Example Usage

### Multi-way Synonyms

```terraform
resource "typesense_synonym" "footwear" {
  collection = typesense_collection.products.name
  name       = "footwear-synonyms"
  synonyms   = ["sneaker", "shoe", "trainer", "footwear"]
}
```

When a user searches for "sneaker", results containing "shoe", "trainer", or "footwear" will also be returned.

### One-way Synonyms

```terraform
resource "typesense_synonym" "jacket" {
  collection = typesense_collection.products.name
  name       = "jacket-synonyms"
  root       = "jacket"
  synonyms   = ["blazer", "coat", "outerwear"]
}
```

When a user searches for "blazer", "coat", or "outerwear", results containing "jacket" will also be returned. However, searching for "jacket" will NOT return results for "blazer".

### Multiple Synonym Rules

```terraform
# Tech terms
resource "typesense_synonym" "tech_terms" {
  collection = typesense_collection.articles.name
  name       = "javascript-synonyms"
  synonyms   = ["javascript", "js", "ecmascript"]
}

# Framework synonyms
resource "typesense_synonym" "react_terms" {
  collection = typesense_collection.articles.name
  name       = "react-synonyms"
  synonyms   = ["react", "reactjs", "react.js"]
}
```

## Import

Synonyms can be imported using the format `collection/synonym_name`:

```shell
terraform import typesense_synonym.footwear products/footwear-synonyms
```
