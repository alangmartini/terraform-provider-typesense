# OPENAI API KEY (Optional)
# ============================================================================
# Used for testing NL Search and Conversation Model features in the chinook
# example. These Typesense features require an OpenAI API key to function.
#
# If not provided, the chinook-test targets will still work but skip the
# NL Search Model and Conversation Model resources (they use count = 0
# when the API key is empty).
#
# To test these features:
# 1. Get an API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 2. Set it below (don't commit this file with your real key!)
