# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Git Workflow

- **Always create a new branch when starting work** on a feature or fix. Use descriptive branch names that reflect the work being done.
- **Commit each atomic change** separately. Each commit should represent a single logical change that can stand on its own.
